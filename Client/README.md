# Compound Habits v1
## App Description
This application will allow users to create an account to be able to create and keep track of their small habits. This sounds like a normal habit tracking app however instead of tracking habits that are in large scale the user has to choose a habit that can be done under 30 seconds when starting until a certain time in which the user can bump that time up. By doing this the user is forced to build a habit that is easy to accomplish and therefore beats the procrastination effect. The end goal is to have an app where not only is the user tracking these small habits but they are encouraged to login, track and keep a log on the day. It is encouraged to check the habits off the so-called list almost immediately after completion. Upon doing this the user will be rewarded with positive praise or something they want. By adding positive reinforcement and being able to get the user to be happy about their accomplishment no matter how small it will make them want to do it again. These principles follow the book Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg and Atomic Habits by James Clear.
